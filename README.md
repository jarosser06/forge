# My AI Development Environment

My default starting template for AI-augmented development projects. 

## Usage

```bash
cookiecutter /path/to/this/repo
```

## What it gives me

- **Claude Code agents** for backend, frontend, infrastructure, and data work
- **Containerized dev environment** with all the tools I actually use
- **MCP servers** for GitHub, Terraform, task management, and knowledge graphs
- **Standard workflow**: generate project → open in VS Code → reopen in container → build

That's it. `./attach_env` to jump into the running container.
